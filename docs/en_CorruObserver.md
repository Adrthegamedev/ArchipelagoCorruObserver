config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Flags are shuffled from their set locations; this means that visiting the Hub could give you the flag for getting the Hunger Mask, and getting the Hunger Mask could give you the flag for examining Dog.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Almost every in-game flag the game uses to track things are shuffled. This optionally includes entity scans.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, a textbox will be printed to the in-game mindspike log.
